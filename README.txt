I request you to pass in the file path as r"<file-path>" as I am using 
pandas read_csv which accepts only if the read mode is open.

Also, I had given some default learning_rates and lambda values already, so
if the output is required for different hyper parameters, it has to be changed
where I am calling the gradient_descent function in each section.

Please do note these things!
